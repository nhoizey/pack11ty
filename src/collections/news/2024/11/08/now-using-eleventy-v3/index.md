[Pack11ty]{.pack11ty} is now based on the [Eleventy v3](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v3/) version!

Also, the code has been fully rewritten to integrate modern JavaScript features like [ECMAScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) (aka ESM), just like Eleventy.

Both [the plugin]({% link_to "/#a-plugin" %}) and [the template repository]({% link_to "/#a-template-repository" %}) (aka Eleventy Starter) have been updated.

There are still some missing parts in the documentation, but they'll be updated ASAP.

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/nhoizey/pack11ty/issues/new/choose) is you find bugs or struggle using this new version.
